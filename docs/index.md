Deployer for Bolt
=================

[Deployer][dep] is a tool written in PHP, to easily and robustly deploy websites. You
are now reading the documentation for the [Bolt][bolt]-specific recipe and
configuration tool, to use Deployer to deploy your Bolt projects.

Deployer is a great tool, and once it's setup properly, you'll be able to do
deploys more often and much quicker than before. You know how some people say
"Don't deploy on Friday"? Well, those people say that, because they are wary
that the deployment will break. Once you have set up your deployment properly,
you'll have no problem deploying whenever.

That freedom comes with a bit of effort in advance, though. Especially the
first time you're doing this, setting up Deployer to run smoothly can take a
bit of work. You will quickly win back that time after the initial setup,
though.

This documentation is split in a few parts to get you up and running:

- [System Requirements](requirements.html)
- [Installation](installation.html)
- [Configuration](configuration.html)
- [Initial Run](initial_run.html)
- [Regular Usage](regular_usage.html)

In the sidebar on the left, you'll also find two pages with Tips and
information for Troubleshooting.
