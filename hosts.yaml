# - repository: URL of the repo, using `https://`, or `git@` protocol,
# - default_branch: default branch to deploy
# - keep_files: Array of files to keep between releases.
# For additional values to set / override, see `Deploy.php` and the reference
# at: https://deployer.org/docs/hosts.html#inventory-file
